# XSpeech: A Novel Deep Learning Approach to Classifying Stutters

This is a project I made for my state-wide science research fair. I apologize for the messy code - It is not intended to be read by another person other than me.

Final weight files/model saves are too large for Github.

This project won the following awards at my state-wide science fair:
- Second Place for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
- Association for Computing Machinery
